## Part I: The Aegis Ecosystem Mission & Vision


**Unifying mission** forms the backbone of the Aegis Group. It was created to shield **maritime entrepreneurs** from legal, operational, and financial risks that frequently go unnoticed. Instead of armed threats, today’s dangers come as bad contracts and fraudulent schemes originating in business offices. The Aegis Group responds to this with a three-pronged protection model:

1. **Aegis Maritime Services (AMS)** provides **forward intelligence**, steering clients away from costly errors through data-driven **due diligence**.
2. **Aegis Maritime Law (AML)** serves as the **legal armor**, equipping clients with robust contracts and counsel.
3. **VessEx** acts as the **final enforcement layer**, recovering assets when traditional avenues fail.

These organizations operate in synergy, particularly focusing on the underserved small commercial vessel market. This segment often lacks internal legal departments or large-scale operational expertise, making them susceptible to issues such as vessel misrepresentation or disadvantageous purchase contracts.


<important>


Aegis aims to be the full-spectrum solution for maritime operators needing protection without enterprise-scale budgets.


</important>

## Part II: The Three Entities (The "What")


**Organizational structure** of Aegis comprises three interconnected entities, each playing a distinct role in its unified mission.

- **Aegis Maritime Services (AMS)** — The **knowledge foundation**:
    - Offers non-legal consulting like market research, operating plans, and **KYV** (Know Your Vessel) diligence.
    - Provides scalable, low-touch services like automated reports and a document portal.
- **Aegis Maritime Law (AML)** — The **legal toolkit**:
    - Delivers both full and limited-scope **maritime legal services**, including contract drafting and advisory.
    - Licenses legal templates to AMS for integration into its automation systems.
- **Vessel Extractions (VessEx)** — The **enforcement arm**:
    - Conducts physical asset recovery in high-risk zones—distinct from judicial vessel arrest.
    - Serves clients ranging from small operators to large corporations.

<example>


A broker might refer a client to AML for a contract review while using AMS for operational due diligence and VessEx for asset retrieval if the deal fails.


</example>


---


## Part III: The Target Market & Client Profile (The "Who")


**Target client profiles** are split between primary, secondary, and strategic partners.

- **Primary Market:** Buyers of used tugs, barges, or workboats priced \$500K–\$3M.
- **Secondary Market:** Budgets below \$500K, often originating from social media. These are served via automated systems.
- **Broker Segment:** Brokers (especially SnP) seeking legal backup due to UPL risks. Direct relationships exist with firms like Ocean Marine Brokerage Services (OMB).

Client personas typically include **owner-operators**, **small business owners**, and **broker-partners**, all of whom are vulnerable due to limited resources or legal awareness. VessEx caters to a broader range, including multi-national oil firms.


<context>


Understanding this segmentation is crucial for designing automation, pricing tiers, and product offerings that align with budget and risk profiles.


</context>


---


## Part IV: The Operator & Available Resources (The "With What")


**Resources supporting operations** include human capital, proprietary content, strategic partnerships, and a robust tech stack.

- **Personnel:**
    - _Michael Bono:_ Founder, LL.M. Admiralty (Tulane), ex-freighter operator.
    - _Max Hardberger:_ Veteran vessel repossession expert, licensed mariner, attorney.
    - _Jasmine Perez:_ CRM lead handler based in Belize.
- **Intellectual Property:**
    - SOPs and templates from the SMB Team and Law Firm Incubator.
    - 20+ years of VessEx press and books by Hardberger.
- **Strategic Relationships:**
    - Close collaboration with OMB (retargeting pixel on site).
    - Membership in the Aliant Law global legal network.
- **Technology:**
    - **Planning:** Grok 4 (strategic planner)
    - **Interface:** Claude Desktop + MCP Toolkit
    - **Data Processing:** Gemini (long context)
    - **Workflow:** n8n + Docker + Dify
    - **Memory & Source Control:** Mem0, Notion, GitHub
    - **Upcoming Tools:** OpenManus (research)
    - **Integration:** context engineering for KV-caching, stable prompts, and prompt resilience

\<code\_example>


# Sample pipeline sync using notion-backup and n8n

- trigger: GitHub commit
- action: backup Notion page
- next: push to Dify KB
\</code\_example>

<thinking>


This ecosystem allows rapid iteration, high RAG efficiency, and agent-based task decomposition.


</thinking>

## Part V: The Strategic Goals (The "Where")


**Strategic roadmap** spans immediate tools, workflows, and business model shifts.

1. **MVP Goals (Q3 2025):**
    - KYV Due Diligence Tool (Datalastic-integrated).
    - Fixed-fee report generator (e.g., small reefers).
    - Strategic Plan Synthesizer.
2. **Lead Funnel Overhaul:**
    - Retargeting Facebook/Instagram leads via OMB pixel.
    - Automated WhatsApp-based triage using Dify/n8n.
    - Tiered content delivery based on budget.
3. **Client Portal Plans:**
    - Explore using [Gavel.io](http://gavel.io/) for legal doc delivery.
    - Alternatively, replicate using Dify/n8n.
4. **Long-Term Model:**
    - Sell legal/advisory **products**, not hourly services.
    - Prioritize **self-service** and **agent-powered interfaces**.

<important>


No automated commits to GitHub allowed—manual SoT review required on all vessel research outputs.


</important>

## Part VI: System Features & Development Backlog


**Current backlog** items reflect product evolution and agent-assisted capabilities.

- **Bibliography Builder (v1-v3)**: From deduplicated lists to annotated citations.
- **Modular Report System**: Based on 6 Intelligence Pillars.
- **AI-Vetted Brand Messaging**: Core tagline integration.
- **Tiered Vessel Chatbot**:
    - v1: Internal.
    - v2: Broker client portal.
    - v3: Throttled/premium layers.
- **Knowledge Capture Agent**: Auto-suggest KB entries via conversation parsing.
- **Gavel-Inspired Intake Portal**:
    - 20-minute KYV form.
    - Auto-delete irrelevant fields.
    - Pricing/format mirrors Gavel's <\$1/hr agent cost.

<answer>


Every feature is aimed at enhancing scalability and automating client interactions without sacrificing due diligence fidelity.


</answer>

## Part VII: System Vision & Ideal Workflow


**Future workflow vision** integrates the above features into a seamless, AI-first operations model.

- **Intelligent Lead Intake**: WhatsApp triage → CRM → Tier segmentation.
- **Content Engine**: Use SMB/Law Incubator for preloaded ad/blog materials.
- **Assistant Agents**: Use clarifying prompts and dynamic handoff logic.
- **KYV Engine**: Real-time alerts from Datalastic, integrated into report UX.
- **Custom Deal Builders**: Use Gavel/Dify conditional logic for self-updating sales packages.
- **Entity Roles**: AMS = productized advisory; AML = bespoke legal; VessEx = field ops.

\<code\_example>


# Lead segmentation logic in Dify:


if lead.budget < 100000:
send(self\_help\_package)
elif lead.budget < 1000000:
send(mid\_tier\_offer)
else:
human\_handoff()
\</code\_example>


<thinking>


Context engineering principles (repetition, stable prompts, GitHub memory) anchor the architecture's resilience.
