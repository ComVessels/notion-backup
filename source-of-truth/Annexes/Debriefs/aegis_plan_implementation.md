### Introduction


This document expands the suggestions from Aegis_Plan_Analysis_v1.0.md into a actionable implementation plan. It addresses key areas like **error logging**, vessel research, **context engineering** evals, cybersecurity, mind map expansions, and RAG benchmarks. Structured in phases with tasks, timelines, owners (e.g., **Grok** for planning, **Claude** for execution), and resources (Dify for agents, n8n for workflows). Focuses on integrating **context engineering** (e.g., recitation for tasks, errors for learning) to enhance resilience.

### Phase 1: Immediate Enhancements (Q3 2025)


**Goal:** Address critical weaknesses/gaps quickly for stability.


**Tasks:**

1. **Implement Manus-Inspired Error Logging in n8n Workflows:**
    - **Description:** Add logging nodes in n8n to capture failures (e.g., API errors in KYV queries), inspired by Manus error inclusion for learning. Use recitation to repeat error checks in workflows.
    - **Timeline:** Week 1-2 (July 2025).
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (planner: design workflow); **Claude** (executor: test in Projects interim).
    - **Resources:** n8n for automation; Dify for error-handling agents; GitHub for logging docs. Integrate with Debriefs annex for self-correction.
2. **Create Cybersecurity Reference Annex:**
    - **Description:** Develop new annex on AI risks in maritime (e.g., intrusion detection, data gaps in AIS per search). Include Manus file memory for persistent threat logs.
    - **Timeline:** Week 3-4.
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (draft outline); **Claude** (refine with XML/role-playing as security expert).
    - **Resources:** Dify for RAG queries on maritime cyber (e.g., source: [imo.org](http://imo.org/) guidelines); n8n for annex commit.
3. **Add Benchmarks for RAG in Dify Tests:**
    - **Description:** Set up evals (e.g., query accuracy on **maritime compliance**) with thresholds; use errors for learning (log failed queries).
    - **Timeline:** Week 5.
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (plan benchmarks); **Claude** (execute tests).
    - **Resources:** Dify for agents; n8n for automated testing workflows.

This phase focuses on quick wins, leveraging **context engineering** for resilient updates.

### Phase 2: Medium-Term Developments (Q4 2025)


**Goal:** Fill content gaps and expand features.


**Tasks:**

1. **Create Dedicated Vessel Research Playbook Annex:**
    - **Description:** Build playbook with mind maps (Blazing Zebra-inspired) for lifecycle (need assessment to ops); include **due diligence** frameworks, regulations (ISM Code/SOLAS). Add recitation checklists to combat drift, error logging for research failures.
    - **Timeline:** October 2025.
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (planner: outline with phases); **Claude** (executor: draft in Projects, incorporate XML for structures).
    - **Resources:** Dify for research agents (e.g., query APIs like Datalastic); n8n for playbook sync to GitHub; integrate search insights on AIS gaps.
2. **Implement Evals for Context Engineering:**
    - **Description:** Add metrics (e.g., drift reduction via recitation) in playbooks like Project_Management_with_Context_Engineering_Playbook_v1.0.md; test error inclusion for resilience (log/analyze failures).
    - **Timeline:** November 2025.
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (design evals); **Claude** (run tests).
    - **Resources:** Dify for eval agents; n8n for automated logging/audits.
3. **Expand Blazing Zebra Mind Maps to All Playbooks:**
    - **Description:** Integrate mind maps for visuals in playbooks (e.g., Report Generation v1.3); use file memory for map storage.
    - **Timeline:** December 2025.
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (plan expansions); **Claude** (generate maps).
    - **Resources:** Dify for map-generation agents; n8n for integration.

This phase builds depth, using resources for scalable enhancements.

### Phase 3: Long-Term Optimizations (Ongoing)


**Goal:** Ensure continuous improvement and full integration.


**Tasks:**

1. **Ongoing Monitoring & Iteration:**
    - **Description:** Quarterly reviews of **error logging** outputs; refine based on learnings (e.g., update cybersecurity annex with new threats).
    - **Timeline:** Starting Q1 2026, quarterly.
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (analyze logs); **Claude** (suggest iterations).
    - **Resources:** n8n for scheduled reviews; Dify for predictive analytics.
2. **Full Transition from Claude Projects to Dify:**
    - **Description:** Migrate interim **Claude Projects** to production Dify; test **context engineering** evals post-transition.
    - **Timeline:** Q2 2026.
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (migration plan); **Claude** (initial tests).
    - **Resources:** n8n for data sync; GitHub for versioned transitions.
3. **Expand RAG Benchmarks & Cybersecurity:**
    - **Description:** Scale benchmarks to all queries; update annex with emerging maritime AI risks (e.g., cyber in autonomous vessels).
    - **Timeline:** Ongoing, bi-annual updates.
    - **Owner:** **Grok** (oversight); **Claude** (updates).
    - **Resources:** Dify for advanced RAG; external searches via tools for updates.

This phase ensures sustainability, with **context engineering** for adaptive learning.
