### Instructions for LLM


**Purpose**: Apply **context engineering** principles to **project management** by treating project context as an engineered resource requiring careful architecture, moving beyond ad-hoc task management to systematic, comprehensive planning.


**Key Principles**:
- **Context as Infrastructure**: Treat project context as a foundational resource requiring deliberate design
- **Systematic Discovery**: Use structured approaches to gather comprehensive project understanding
- **Adaptive Planning**: Build plans that evolve while preserving core context
- **Continuous Context Management**: Maintain and update project context throughout execution
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Transform individual insights into actionable project intelligence


**Process Notes**:
- This approach consists of three integrated workflow phases: Discovery → Planning → Execution/Closure
- Each phase builds upon previous context while adding new layers of understanding
- Use TodoWrite extensively throughout all phases to track progress and maintain context
- Reference cross-workflow context continuously to ensure alignment and minimize overlap
