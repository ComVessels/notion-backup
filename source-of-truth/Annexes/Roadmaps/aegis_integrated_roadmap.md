**DIFFS (Applied Below):**

- **DIFF: Original: No pipeline/Mem0/sub-agents. Revised: Added to phases (e.g., Phase 1 complete with pipeline)—reason: Consistency with v5.4.**
- **DIFF: Original: Timelines ASAP/Q3-Q4. Revised: Refined for Q3 focus—reason: Reflect progress.**

### Guiding Principles


The development of the Aegis AI system will be guided by the methodologies, playbooks, and protocols established in our Knowledge Base. All technical implementations must align with the \"Aegis Blueprint\" and be executed using the \"Aegis Documentation Lifecycle Playbook.\" The primary orchestrating agent for development and interaction will be the **Claude Desktop** application, utilizing its MCP toolkit. Emphasize **context engineering** principles (e.g., caching for cost savings, file memory for scalability) from Context_Engineering_Guide_v1.0.md to ensure stability and efficiency in **AI agents**.

### Overall Approach: Phased Implementation


We will follow a phased implementation plan to deliver value as quickly as possible, focusing on discrete business capabilities like **report generation** and **lead qualification**. Integrate **Dify** for agents, **n8n** for workflows, and **hallucination mitigations** (strict thresholds 0.05-0.01, fallback prompts like \"I don't know\", corrective **RAG** with query rewrites/retries, post-output validation).


### 2.1 Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Complete)

- **Objective:** Establish a complete, vetted understanding of the Aegis Group's mission, entities, resources, and goals; build core system for automating client-facing reports.
- **Key Artifacts/Components:**
    - The Aegis Blueprint v5.4.
    - The Aegis Detailed Operational Briefing (merged into Blueprint).
    - Aegis AI System Methodology v1.1.
    - **Knowledge Refiner (Dify Agent):** Process raw research notes, convert endnotes to inline citations; explore citation porting for consolidated reports.
    - **Report Drafter (Dify Agent):** Use comprehensive template for polished reports from \"Raw Intelligence Document\".
    - **Automation (n8n):** Connect steps; integrate KB sync (GitHub to Dify).
    - **Template-First Development:** Search for tested templates (e.g., GitHub for n8n/Dify); use Grok 4 for **Claude-optimized prompts** (XML tagging per best practices); debug in Claude Desktop.
    **UPDATED: Add hallucination mitigations; incorporate context engineering (stable prompts for caching). Completed Notion → GitHub → Dify pipeline via notion-backup (5-min syncs). Added Mem0 for memory.**
- **Tasks:** Formally set up Google Drive for temporary large data processing (Gemini); primary KB in GitHub with Notion editing.

### 2.2 Phase 2: Playbook Development & Lead Qualification (In Progress/Q3 2025)

- **Objective:** Mine expert source materials into actionable playbooks for high-priority functions; automate lead qualification from social media.
- **Tasks & Priority:**
    1. **Create the \"Aegis Report Generation Playbook\" (Top Priority):** Detailed SOP adapting HIGH END CONSULTING WITH GEMINI.docx for current stack (not Gemini); formalize process for client reports.
    2. **Create the \"Aegis Marketing Playbook\" (De-prioritized):** On hold until report system operational.
    3. **Other Playbooks:** As needed (on hold); add KB organization playbook, integrate Dify/n8n for updates.
- **Components:**
    - **Lead Qualification Agent (Dify Agent):** Scoped to marketing/FAQs; conducts WhatsApp conversations.
    - **Orchestration (n8n):** Trigger from lead form; log in Zoho CRM; pass to Dify; execute follow-up (e.g., email PDF, notify team).
    **UPDATED: ASAP integration with KB for querying; apply context engineering (mask tools to avoid overwhelm). Add Claude sub-agents hybrid for qualification.**

### 2.3 Phase 3: Interim System Setup & First Execution (Q3 2025)

- **Objective:** Set up interim system (Claude Projects/Dify + Drive KB) for immediate client-ready work.
- **Tasks:**
    1. Create dedicated personas (e.g., Auditor, Knowledge Refiner, Report Drafter) as Claude Projects (not Gems).
    2. **Execute First Major Task:** Use system and Report Generation Playbook for deep research report (test consolidation/citations) before Synergy ALE project.
    *Updated: Transition to Claude Projects/Dify; integrate with Dify KB; add **hallucination mitigations** evals in n8n. Add Mem0 testing; Claude sub-agents for tasks.

(Word count: 112)


### 2.4 Phase 4: Full System Architecture & Research Automation (Q3-Q4 2025)

- **Objective:** Design/build final automated system with deep research connected to generation.
- **Components:**
    - **Research Agent (OpenManus):** Self-hosted for secure web research (Phase 4 of report workflow).
    - **End-to-End Orchestration (n8n):** Connect OpenManus to Dify agents for seamless process.
    - **Additional:** Research library generation (vessel sales for small ops via Grok 4 Heavy/Gemini); Claude Projects for interim, Dify for production.
    **UPDATED: Add context engineering (use files as memory for long tasks, include errors for resilience); research library with due diligence focus. Integrate Mem0/Claude sub-agents.**

(Word count: 128)


### Audit Protocol & AI Dispatcher Role


No technology implementation plan will be executed until formally audited by \"Aegis Auditor\" persona, verifying claims against tool docs (Dify, n8n). The \"Aegis Strategic Planner\" (Grok) guides by generating **Claude-specific prompts** adhering to `Claude_Prompting_Best_Practices` (XML tagging).

### Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Objective Setting:** Reference this Roadmap; agree on task.
2. **Execution:** Perform task.
3. **Documentation:** Create versioned document for KB if new process/decision (full header/Path).
4. **Next Step Definition:** Confirm accomplishments; define next.
*Updated: Use Notion for edits, n8n for sync to GitHub/Dify.

### Appendix: Grok Collaboration Debrief


This appendix memorializes progress from Grok on RAG prototype/Dify setup.


### Accomplishments

- Initial Plan Assessment: Reviewed ~15 Markdown files; evaluations on viability (8/10), architecture (7/10); recommendations like SWOT/MVP pilots.
- Grok 4 Integration: Configured via Zen MCP; upgraded to SuperGrok Heavy; verified API routing.
- RAG Prototype Test: Generated/ran Python script for FAISS-based RAG; successful query on risks (\"deceptive shipping practices\").
- Overarching Goal: Viable KMS via RAG (9/10); hybrid Grok for reasoning.

### Challenges and Resolutions

- Lossiness: Used extractive methods.
- Setup Hurdles: Fixed module errors with pip; PATH with export.
- Quotas: 19 turns limit; mitigated by efficient prompting.

### Next Steps

- Short-Term (1-3 Days): Dify MVP in 2-4 hours; test queries, generate reports.
- Medium-Term (1 Week): Polish for revenue (e.g., KYV reports).
- Long-Term: Scale to 2-3 apps; quarterly reassess.

This supports Phases 1-4, emphasizing quick MVP for revenue.
*Updated: Added Dify **hallucination mitigations**, n8n rules.
