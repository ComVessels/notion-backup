## Executive Summary


**Urgent report generation** is the business driver for this roadmap. Despite a functional knowledge pipeline from Notion to GitHub to the **Dify RAG system**, there's a disconnect: **Claude sub-agents lack seamless access to this knowledge context**. Michael has successfully used a manual orchestration workflow—spanning ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and [Napkin.ai](http://napkin.ai/)—to produce high-quality reports, but this method is not scalable.


<important>


Michael must produce revenue-generating client reports within one week. The current bottleneck is efficient context delivery to AI agents.


</important>


The aim is to identify the **fastest path** to scalable report generation using prebuilt agent frameworks with minimal technical lift.


---


## Current State of Systems


**System development to date** has yielded a strong foundation:

- **Knowledge Management:** A Notion → GitHub → Dify pipeline with 5-minute syncs and \~20 Source of Truth (SoT) documents.
- **RAG Readiness:** Dify returns contextual answers with citations. Agents like the Knowledge Refiner and Auditor are defined.
- **Manual Success:** Michael produced high-quality reports using a 6-stage manual process, confirmed by client satisfaction.
- **Technical Barrier:** Claude sub-agents lack direct access to Dify or other external context sources.

<example>


Manual context loading into Grok (via 20 Markdown files) works but is labor-intensive.


</example>


<important>


Automation attempts—like n8n, MCP, and webhook-based orchestration—have either failed or consumed excessive time.


</important>


---


## Critical Business Need


**Revenue generation** depends on delivering these reports quickly:

1. Strategic Plans
2. Market Research Reports (vessel-type specific)
3. Know Your Vessel (KYV) Reports
4. Future: Lead qualification system

**Time constraint:** All reporting must begin within **48 hours**, with delivery in **7 days**.


---


## Proposed Integration Solutions


**Five integration approaches** were evaluated during Aegis Config Session 18:

1. **Reference Document Pattern**
Manual file-based context sharing. Fastest setup.
_Time: 30 minutes_
2. **Dify Webhook Query**
Agent-start commands that query Dify for context via curl.
_Time: 1 hour_
3. **Context Accumulation System**
A dynamic context document that updates with use.
_Time: 2 hours_
4. **Agent-Assisted Manual Process**
Four sub-agents mirror the manual process steps.
_Recommended by Claude_
5. **Contains Studio Agent Templates**
Use GitHub-hosted sub-agents for fast, structured implementation.
_Time: Minutes per agent_[Source](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents)

<context>


Each option varies in complexity and speed. The recommendation is to adopt **Option 1 + Option 5** immediately, while monitoring Option 4 as a longer-term strategy.

## Strategic Questions for Assessment


**1. Fastest Context Connection?**
Use **context files** and Claude-native file loading. Dify remains the backend source of truth.


**2. Quick vs. Proper Integration?**
Start with the quick-and-dirty solution. Prioritize revenue, not architectural purity.


**3. Avoiding Automation Pitfalls?**
Stay away from over-engineering. Every failed approach stemmed from complexity.


**4. Integration Abandonment?**
Yes—abandon MCP and n8n unless needs change.


**5. 48-Hour Plan?**
Use Contains Studio agents + context markdown files. Create one full report manually augmented by agents.


**6. Agent Management?**
Adopt Contains Studio’s structure and adapt per Aegis’s research needs. No code. No custom builds.


**7. Maritime Adaptation?**
Clone academic/business templates. Rename agents. Add Dify context logic where applicable.

## Agent Management Requirements


**Michael’s constraints**:

- No custom development
- Fast implementation (minutes, not hours)
- Clear, scalable agent hierarchy
- Professionalism in naming and task separation

### Viable Framework: Contains Studio


\<code\_example>


# Repo: [https://github.com/contains-studio/agents](https://github.com/contains-studio/agents)


# Prebuilt templates:

- Academic Writer
- Business Analyst
- Content Creator
- Git Assistant
\</code\_example>

<thinking>


These agents follow proven prompting structures, are easy to rename, and avoid code-based setup. They represent the best combination of speed and professionalism.


</thinking>

## Recommended Agent Hierarchy


**Tier 1: Orchestration Agents**

- `aegis-master`: Main orchestrator
- `context-manager`: Distributes and uploads Dify-based context

**Tier 2: Research & Analysis**

- `maritime-researcher`
- `market-analyst`
- `legal-analyst`

**Tier 3: Content Production**

- `report-writer`
- `citation-manager`
- `visual-designer`

**Tier 4: Specialized Tools**

- `panama-registry`
- `insurance-checker`
- `vessel-data-aggregator`

<answer>


This hierarchy reflects Michael’s existing report pattern, using Contains Studio as the foundation.

## Immediate Actions and Week 1 Goals


### **Next 48 Hours**

- [ ] Clone and configure Contains Studio agents
- [ ] Create base context markdown for current client
- [ ] Assign context-manager to upload all SoT docs to Claude
- [ ] Produce one full AI-assisted report using manual outline + agent mix

### **Week 1 Deliverables**

- Strategic Report v1
- Context-injected Claude agents
- Documented process
- Agent template system ready for reuse

<important>


Avoid all new automation tools this week. Focus on reusing what's proven.


</important>


---


## Success Criteria

- **Day 2**: Report in progress
- **Day 5**: Final draft delivered
- **Day 7**: Documented, repeatable system
- **Week 2**: Second report 2x faster

<answer>


Revenue by week’s end is the goal. Achieve this via minimal setup, maximal reuse.
